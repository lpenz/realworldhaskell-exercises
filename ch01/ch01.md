1. Enter the following expressions into ghci. What are their types?

:t 5 + 8
5 + 8 :: Num a => a

:t 3 * 5 + 8
3 * 5 + 8 :: Num a => a

:t 2 + 4
2 + 4 :: Num a => a

:t (+) 2 4
(+) 2 4 :: Num a => a

:t sqrt 16
sqrt 16 :: Floating a => a

:t succ 6
succ 6 :: (Num a, Enum a) => a

:t succ 7
succ 7 :: (Num a, Enum a) => a

:t pred 9
pred 9 :: (Num a, Enum a) => a

:t pred 8
pred 8 :: (Num a, Enum a) => a

:t sin (pi / 2)
sin (pi / 2) :: Floating a => a

:t truncate pi

round 3.5 :: Integral b => b

:t round 3.4
round 3.4 :: Integral b => b

:t floor 3.7
floor 3.7 :: Integral b => b

:t ceiling 3.3
ceiling 3.3 :: Integral b => b


2. From ghci, type :? to print some help. Define a variable, such as let x = 1, then type :show bindings. What do you see?

Prelude> let x = 1
Prelude> :show bindings
x :: Num t => t = _


3. The words function counts the number of words in a string. Modify the WC.hs example to count the number of words in a file.

> See wc3.hs


4. Modify the WC.hs example again, to print the number of characters in a file.

> See wc4.hs

## Exercises - block 1

1. What are the types of the following expressions?

:t False
False :: Bool

:t (["foo", "bar"], 'a')
(["foo", "bar"], 'a') :: ([[Char]], Char)

:t [(True, []), (False, [['a']])]
[(True, []), (False, [['a']])] :: [(Bool, [[Char]])]

(extra)
:t [(True, [], 5), (False, [['a']], 0)]
[(True, [], 5), (False, [['a']], 0)] :: Num t => [(Bool, [[Char]], t)]


## Exercises - block 2

1. Haskell provides a standard function, last :: [a] -> a, that returns the
   last element of a list. From reading the type alone, what are the possible
   valid behaviours (omitting crashes and infinite loops) that this function could
   have? What are a few things that this function clearly cannot do?

The function is not total, as it has no defined behaviour on empty lists.


2. Write a function lastButOne, that returns the element before the last.

lastButOne :: [a] -> a
lastButOne = last . init


3. Load your lastButOne function into ghci, and try it out on lists of
   different lengths. What happens when you pass it a list that's too short?

`*** Exception: Prelude.last: empty list`
